# 3D Graphics ACW (University assignment)
A 3D Graphic program created using Open GL and Shaders. This was part of the 3D Graphic module during the second semester of year 2 university (Early 2020).

## About 3D Graphics Open GL
The aim of this project was to create a 3D scene using Open GL and shaders. The specification included:

• Adding 2 Primitive objects (Such as cube and cone)

• Adding 1 existing model

• Using draw calls, vertex buffer objects and vertex array objects

• Use multiple shaders

• Add multiple fixed cameras and a user controlled camera

• Implement different types of lights (Such as Directional, spotlight and pointlight)

• Add textures that works with lighting

• Add object animation (Special feature)

• Use frame buffer for post processing effects (Special feature)

## The project
By the end of this project, I was able to create a 3D scene using Open GL that met all of the specifiction. I decided on adding 5 main object types, which are the following:

• 1 cone

• 1 cube

• 1 existing armadillo

• 3 spheres

• 5 flat planes (Walls and floor)


I also used object oriented programming and 6 shaders in total. These shaders are 2 material shaders, 2 texture shaders and 2 frame buffer shaders.

In addition to this, I also learnt about the open GL graphic pipeline. This includes knowledge about the vertex shader, resterization and fragment shader. Overall, I enjoyed this project a lot as it taught me about graphics at a lower level.

## The Module Results
In this module, I achieved 96% which is equivalent to a first.
